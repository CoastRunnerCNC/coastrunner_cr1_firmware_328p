// Define the homing cycle patterns with bitmasks. The homing cycle first performs a search mode
// to quickly engage the limit switches, followed by a slower locate mode, and finished by a short
// pull-off motion to disengage the limit switches. The following HOMING_CYCLE_x defines are executed
// in order starting with suffix 0 and completes the homing routine for the specified-axes only. If
// an axis is omitted from the defines, it will not home, nor will the system update its position.
// Meaning that this allows for users with non-standard cartesian machines, such as a lathe (x then z,
// with no y), to configure the homing cycle behavior to their needs.
// NOTE: The homing cycle is designed to allow sharing of limit pins, if the axes are not in the same
// cycle, but this requires some pin settings changes in cpu_map.h file. For example, the default homing
// cycle can share the Z limit pin with either X or Y limit pins, since they are on different cycles.
// By sharing a pin, this frees up a precious IO pin for other purposes. In theory, all axes limit pins
// may be reduced to one pin, if all axes are homed with seperate cycles, or vice versa, all three axes
// on separate pin, but homed in one cycle. Also, it should be noted that the function of hard limits
// will not be affected by pin sharing.

// ADVANCED CONFIGURATION OPTIONS:

// Configure rapid, feed, and spindle override settings. These values define the max and min

#define SPINDLE_OVERRIDE_COARSE_INCREMENT  10 // (1-99). Usually 10%.
#define SPINDLE_OVERRIDE_FINE_INCREMENT     1 // (1-99). Usually 1%.

// When a M2 or M30 program end command is executed, most g-code states are restored to their defaults.
// This compile-time option includes the restoring of the feed, rapid, and spindle speed override values
// to their default values at program end.
#define RESTORE_OVERRIDES_AFTER_PROGRAM_END // Default enabled. Comment to disable.

// The status report change for Grbl v1.1 and after also removed the ability to disable/enable most data
// fields from the report. This caused issues for GUI developers, who've had to manage several scenarios
// and configurations. The increased efficiency of the new reporting style allows for all data fields to 
// be sent without potential performance issues.
// NOTE: The options below are here only provide a way to disable certain data fields if a unique
// situation demands it, but be aware GUIs may depend on this data. If disabled, it may not be compatible.

#define REPORT_FIELD_LINE_NUMBERS // Return line number, if contained in source g-code (e.g. N123). ('?')

// Some status report data isn't necessary for realtime, only intermittently, because the values don't
// change often. The following macros configures how many times a status report needs to be called before
// the associated data is refreshed and included in the status report. However, if one of these value
// changes, Grbl will automatically include this data in the next status report, regardless of what the
// count is at the time. This helps reduce the communication overhead involved with high frequency reporting
// and agressive streaming. There is also a busy and an idle refresh count, which sets up Grbl to send
// refreshes more often when its not doing anything important. With a good GUI, this data doesn't need
// to be refreshed very often, on the order of a several seconds.
// NOTE: WCO refresh must be 2 or greater. OVR refresh must be 1 or greater.
#define REPORT_OVR_REFRESH_BUSY_COUNT 20  // (1-255)

#define REPORT_WCO_REFRESH_IDLE_COUNT 10  // (2-255) Must be less than or equal to the busy count

// The temporal resolution of the acceleration management subsystem. A higher number gives smoother
// acceleration, particularly noticeable on machines that run at very high feedrates, but may negatively
// impact performance. The correct value for this parameter is machine dependent, so it's advised to
// set this only as high as needed. Approximate successful values can widely range from 50 to 200 or more.
// NOTE: Changing this value also changes the execution time of a segment in the step segment buffer.
// When increasing this value, this stores less overall time in the segment buffer and vice versa. Make
// certain the step segment buffer is increased/decreased to account for these changes.
#define ACCELERATION_TICKS_PER_SECOND 100

// Adaptive Multi-Axis Step Smoothing (AMASS) is an advanced feature that does what its name implies,
// smoothing the stepping of multi-axis motions. This feature smooths motion particularly at low step
// frequencies below 10kHz, where the aliasing between axes of multi-axis motions can cause audible
// noise and shake your machine. At even lower step frequencies, AMASS adapts and provides even better
// step smoothing. See stepper.c for more details on the AMASS system works.
#define ADAPTIVE_MULTI_AXIS_STEP_SMOOTHING  // Default enabled. Comment to disable.

// Sets the maximum step rate allowed to be written as a Grbl setting. This option enables an error
// check in the settings module to prevent settings values that will exceed this limitation. The maximum
// step rate is strictly limited by the CPU speed and will change if something other than an AVR running
// at 16MHz is used.
// NOTE: For now disabled, will enable if flash space permits.
#define MAX_STEP_RATE_HZ 30000 // Hz

// Sets which axis the tool length offset is applied. Assumes the spindle is always parallel with
// the selected axis with the tool oriented toward the negative direction. In other words, a positive
// tool length offset value is subtracted from the current location.
#define TOOL_LENGTH_OFFSET_AXIS Z_AXIS // Default z-axis. Valid values are X_AXIS, Y_AXIS, or Z_AXIS.

// Used by variable spindle output only. This forces the PWM output to a minimum duty cycle when enabled.
// The PWM pin will still read 0V when the spindle is disabled. Most users will not need this option, but
// it may be useful in certain scenarios. This minimum PWM settings coincides with the spindle rpm minimum
// setting, like rpm max to max PWM. This is handy if you need a larger voltage difference between 0V disabled
// and the voltage set by the minimum PWM for minimum rpm. This difference is 0.02V per PWM value. So, when
// minimum PWM is at 1, only 0.02 volts separate enabled and disabled. At PWM 5, this would be 0.1V. Keep
// in mind that you will begin to lose PWM resolution with increased minimum PWM values, since you have less
// and less range over the total 255 PWM levels to signal different spindle speeds.
// NOTE: Compute duty cycle at the minimum PWM by this equation: (% duty cycle)=(SPINDLE_PWM_MIN_VALUE/255)*100
// #define SPINDLE_PWM_MIN_VALUE 5 // Default disabled. Uncomment to enable. Must be greater than zero. Integer (1-255).

// With this enabled, Grbl sends back an echo of the line it has received, which has been pre-parsed (spaces
// removed, capitalized letters, no comments) and is to be immediately executed by Grbl. Echoes will not be
// sent upon a line buffer overflow, but should for all normal lines sent to Grbl. For example, if a user
// sends the line 'g1 x1.032 y2.45 (test comment)', Grbl will echo back in the form '[echo: G1X1.032Y2.45]'.
// NOTE: Only use this for debugging purposes!! When echoing, this takes up valuable resources and can affect
// performance. If absolutely needed for normal operation, the serial write buffer should be greatly increased
// to help minimize transmission waiting within the serial write protocol.
// #define REPORT_ECHO_LINE_RECEIVED // Default disabled. Uncomment to enable.

// Minimum planner junction speed. Sets the default minimum junction speed the planner plans to, at
// every buffer block junction, except for starting from rest and end of the buffer, which are always
// zero. This value controls how fast the machine moves through junctions with no regard for acceleration
// limits or angle between neighboring block line move directions. This is useful for machines that can't
// tolerate the tool dwelling for a split second. If used, this value
// should not be much greater than zero or to the minimum value necessary for the machine to work.
#define MINIMUM_JUNCTION_SPEED 0.0 // (mm/min)

// Sets the minimum feed rate the planner will allow. Any value below it will be set to this minimum
// value. This also ensures that a planned motion always completes and accounts for any floating-point
// round-off errors. Although not recommended, a lower value than 1.0 mm/min will likely work in smaller
// machines, perhaps to 0.1mm/min, but your success may vary based on multiple factors.
#define MINIMUM_FEED_RATE 1.0 // (mm/min)

// Number of arc generation iterations by small angle approximation before exact arc trajectory
// correction with expensive sin() and cos() calcualtions. This parameter may be decreased if there
// are issues with the accuracy of the arc generations, or increased if arc execution is getting
// bogged down by too many trig calculations.
#define N_ARC_CORRECTION 12 // Integer (1-255)

// The arc G2/3 g-code standard is problematic by definition. Radius-based arcs have horrible numerical
// errors when arc at semi-circles(pi) or full-circles(2*pi). Offset-based arcs are much more accurate
// but still have a problem when arcs are full-circles (2*pi). This define accounts for the floating
// point issues when offset-based arcs are commanded as full circles, but get interpreted as extremely
// small arcs with around machine epsilon (1.2e-7rad) due to numerical round-off and precision issues.
// This define value sets the machine epsilon cutoff to determine if the arc is a full-circle or not.
// NOTE: Be very careful when adjusting this value. It should always be greater than 1.2e-7 but not too
// much greater than this. The default setting should capture most, if not all, full arc error situations.
#define ARC_ANGULAR_TRAVEL_EPSILON 5E-7 // Float (radians)

// Time delay increments performed during a dwell. The default value is set at 50ms, which provides
// a maximum time delay of roughly 55 minutes, more than enough for most any application. Increasing
// this delay will increase the maximum dwell time linearly, but also reduces the responsiveness of
// run-time command executions, like status reports, since these are performed between each dwell
// time step. Also, keep in mind that the Arduino delay timer is not very accurate for long delays.
#define DWELL_TIME_STEP 50 // Integer (1-255) (milliseconds)

// Creates a delay between the direction pin setting and corresponding step pulse by creating
// another interrupt (Timer2 compare) to manage it. The main Grbl interrupt (Timer1 compare)
// sets the direction pins, and does not immediately set the stepper pins, as it would in
// normal operation. The Timer2 compare fires next to set the stepper pins after the step
// pulse delay time, and Timer2 overflow will complete the step pulse, except now delayed
// by the step pulse time plus the step pulse delay. (Thanks langwadt for the idea!)
// NOTE: Uncomment to enable. The delay must be greater than 3us, and, when added with the
// user-supplied step pulse time, the total time must not exceed 127us. Reported successful
// values for certain setups have ranged from 5 to 20us.
// #define STEP_PULSE_DELAY 10 // Step pulse delay in microseconds. Default disabled.

// Configures the position after a probing cycle during Grbl's check mode. Disabled sets
// the position to the probe target, when enabled sets the position to the start position.
#define SET_CHECK_MODE_PROBE_TO_START // Default disabled. Uncomment to enable.

// Adjusts homing cycle search and locate scalars. These are the multipliers used by Grbl's
// homing cycle to ensure the limit switches are engaged and cleared through each phase of
// the cycle. The search phase uses the axes max-travel setting times the SEARCH_SCALAR to
// determine distance to look for the limit switch. Once found, the locate phase begins and
// uses the homing pull-off distance setting times the LOCATE_SCALAR to pull-off and re-engage
// the limit switch.
// NOTE: Both of these values must be greater than 1.0 to ensure proper function.
// #define HOMING_AXIS_SEARCH_SCALAR  1.5 // Uncomment to override defaults in limits.c.
// #define HOMING_AXIS_LOCATE_SCALAR  10.0 // Uncomment to override defaults in limits.c.

// Enable the '$RST=*', '$RST=$', and '$RST=#' eeprom restore commands. There are cases where
// these commands may be undesirable. Simply comment the desired macro to disable it.
// NOTE: See SETTINGS_RESTORE_ALL macro for customizing the `$RST=*` command.

// Enable the '$I=(string)' build info write command. If disabled, any existing build info data must
// be placed into EEPROM via external means with a valid checksum value. This macro option is useful
// to prevent this data from being over-written by a user, when used to store OEM product data.
// NOTE: If disabled and to ensure Grbl can never alter the build info line, you'll also need to enable
// the SETTING_RESTORE_ALL macro above and remove SETTINGS_RESTORE_BUILD_INFO from the mask.
// NOTE: See the included grblWrite_BuildInfo.ino example file to write this string seperately.
#define ENABLE_BUILD_INFO_WRITE_COMMAND // '$I=' Default enabled. Comment to disable.

// AVR processors require all interrupts to be disabled during an EEPROM write. This includes both
// the stepper ISRs and serial comm ISRs. In the event of a long EEPROM write, this ISR pause can
// cause active stepping to lose position and serial receive data to be lost. This configuration
// option forces the planner buffer to completely empty whenever the EEPROM is written to prevent
// any chance of lost steps.
// However, this doesn't prevent issues with lost serial RX data during an EEPROM write, especially
// if a GUI is premptively filling up the serial RX buffer simultaneously. It's highly advised for
// GUIs to flag these gcodes (G10,G28.1,G30.1) to always wait for an 'ok' after a block containing
// one of these commands before sending more data to eliminate this issue.
// NOTE: Most EEPROM write commands are implicitly blocked during a job (all '$' commands). However,
// coordinate set g-code commands (G10,G28/30.1) are not, since they are part of an active streaming
// job. At this time, this option only forces a planner buffer sync with these g-code commands.
#define FORCE_BUFFER_SYNC_DURING_EEPROM_WRITE // Default enabled. Comment to disable.

// In Grbl v0.9 and prior, there is an old outstanding bug where the `WPos:` work position reported
// may not correlate to what is executing, because `WPos:` is based on the g-code parser state, which
// can be several motions behind. This option forces the planner buffer to empty, sync, and stop
// motion whenever there is a command that alters the work coordinate offsets `G10,G43.1,G92,G54-59`.
// This is the simplest way to ensure `WPos:` is always correct. Fortunately, it's exceedingly rare
// that any of these commands are used need continuous motions through them.
#define FORCE_BUFFER_SYNC_DURING_WCO_CHANGE // Default enabled. Comment to disable.

// By default, Grbl disables feed rate overrides for all G38.x probe cycle commands. Although this
// may be different than some pro-class machine control, it's arguable that it should be this way. 
// Most probe sensors produce different levels of error that is dependent on rate of speed. By 
// keeping probing cycles to their programmed feed rates, the probe sensor should be a lot more
// repeatable. If needed, you can disable this behavior by uncommenting the define below.
// #define ALLOW_FEED_OVERRIDE_DURING_PROBE_CYCLES // Default disabled. Uncomment to enable.
