// Line buffer size from the serial input stream to be executed. Also, governs the size of
// each of the startup blocks, as they are each stored as a string of this size. Make sure
// to account for the available EEPROM at the defined memory address in settings.h and for
// the number of desired startup blocks.
// NOTE: 80 characters is not a problem except for extreme cases, but the line buffer size
// can be too small and g-code blocks can get truncated. Officially, the g-code standards
// support up to 256 characters. In future versions, this default will be increased, when
// we know how much extra memory space we can re-invest into this, or we re-write the g-code 
// parser not to have this buffer.
#define LINE_BUFFER_SIZE 80


// Starts Grbl main loop. It handles all incoming characters from the serial port and executes
// them as they complete. It is also responsible for finishing the initialization procedures.

void protocol_exec_rt_system();

// Executes the auto cycle feature, if enabled.
